(I apoligise in advance for the sloppy writing. Unfortuntately my whole readme file was deleted during the Commit process so I am forced to rewrite this at 6am).

The main idea with this one was to create an interactive interface that asks users to select a mood, visualised through floating presets reflecting how digital systems reduce emotion to selectable options. I called this the Lazurus Cafe as people usually go to cafes to find a sense of safety and comfort. The word lazurus came from my love of the DC universe taking inspiration from the Lazurus Pit where the dead could be revived through soaking in the water of the pit. I was also inspired through my own experiences with music and visuals which often created a sense of safety and comfort for me online. I wanted to recreate ths whilst showing the limitations of digital systems that rely on presets. 

I was also inspired by a bunch of youtube videos that helped me to bring all my ideas together. Taking codes and experimenting with them was a huge part of my process using trial and error to push forward up to this point. 
Here are some of the videos used below:
